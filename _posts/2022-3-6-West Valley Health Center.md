My manager was very unsure when I first reccomended West Valley as the next best place to extend ambulatory care over 2 years ago.

It didn’t fit with our current plans and land acquisition.

It wasn’t considered an up and coming area, like other Wasatch Front communities.

However there were unique qualities about this market, qualities that were accessed through detailed market analysis.

Refining my models and uncovering new data insights only led to further confirmation that West Valley was the place to go and that we needed to go bigger than we had originally planned not only expanding ambulatory care but putting inpatient beds in the market as well.

The idea soon spread from my R/Python code to lots of others who took it and ran including my manager. I am proud that I got to be one of the first involved with this project and I am impressed (but not surprised) with how many other people across the health system have transformed, elevated, and improved this project to where it is today.

My goal is not to take credit for this because that would be absurd. I just wanted to express how excited I am. This project will be always be one of my favorites and one that I hold near and dear.

I can’t wait to see the hospital someday and be reminded that my work as an entry level data analyst had some small, real-world impact.
