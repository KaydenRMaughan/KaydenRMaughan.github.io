Many are surprised when they find out that I graduated with my bachelors and masters degree in 3 years, while working.

Here are some takeaways from my experience that might help in career or educational aspirations.

1. Making come backs out of set backs.
I thought my life was over when I was cut from the BYU football team after a few weeks of being part of the practice squad. But it enabled me to focus on why I was really at BYU, to learn and prepare for a career. I had to “fail fast to succeed sooner.”

2. Recognize the support around you. I would not have been able to do this without the support of my wife, my parents, my coworkers and classmates, my professors and supervisors, and my Heavenly Father. Find people who want to help you succeed and try to help them succeed as well.

3. Embrace the grind. Challenge yourself even if it has never been done before. These last three years have been full of stress and anxiety, but “vale la pena” (it’s worth the hardship)

4. Be strategic. I looked for advantages and positioned myself to be as successful as I could be. I learned that fluffy sayings an motivation will only be that unless you have true plans and objectives. Be tactical and clever with your goals and plans. Play smarter as well as harder.

So excited for what lies ahead!
