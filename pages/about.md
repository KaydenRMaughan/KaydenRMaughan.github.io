## **About me**

Saturday. April 16, 2016, Ecuador

The 7.8 magnitude quake shook the ground. Although ~90 miles from the epicenter, we still felt the force that caused instantaneous terror. People began to run in every direction. The electric transformers and powerlines that ran through the only paved road in the city turned into a parade of explosions that left us in the dark. 

As a missionary, I instinctively looked to see who I could help. We quickly gathered our supplies and headed into the streets. Then reports started to come in about the areas most affected, areas that I had just been reassigned from. Manta, Bahia, Chone, and perhaps worst of all Pedernales, in destruction. My heart ached for the people I had met and had grown to love. The panic that accompanied the general uncertainty combined with the fear of what lay in store, left us all extremely anxious and at the same time, emotionally paralyzed. 

In the days and weeks that followed, my paradigm about life shifted. "Encontrar desafios y hallar soluciones" (Identify the challenge, search for solutions) was the guiding phrase that led me from that point on. We identified short-term and long-term challenges
