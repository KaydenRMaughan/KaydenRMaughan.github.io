# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
5 year ago, I was waiting for a bus in an impoverished community northwest of Guayaquil, Ecuador when suddenly, the earth began to quake. Power lines sparked and transformers exploded preceeding an omnious overabundance of darkness. No one felt safe nor secure. Everyone was trying to understand what had just happened. The world was literally crumbling and we needed solutions. Helping people understand challenging situations, find creative solutions, and predict future outcomes became something I was passionate about.

Upon returning to the United States, I rediscovered my skills and talents with mathematics, picked up some statistical programming, and tried to put myself on a path to help people, organizations, and businesses truly understand what is going on, develop creative strategies, and forecast potential results.
